# Quantitative_Trading_LSTM
## Introduction
(This project is collaborated by two sophomore students, not yet completed)<br><br>
With the aim to gain a deeper understanding and direction to know more about quant trading, we would like to build a project including price prediction, backtesting and algo-trading to identify the major obstacles in it.<br><br>
Therefore, instead of achieving highly efficient methods, we tend to perform a joruney of how we discover the unknown in quant trading.




# Structure of the project

### Model & Research
In this directory, we will show how to train the best-fit LSTM model for each target stock. And the result will be stored to Resources directory

### Resources
The best-models trained for every target stock will be placed here. A function is designed to gain the latest sets of predicted closing price of a stock by accessing its best-models here.
